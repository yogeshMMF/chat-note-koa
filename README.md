Node.js Koa with Socket.IO Routing â€“ Repository Description
This repository demonstrates how to integrate Socket.IO with a Koa.js application while maintaining a clean and scalable routing structure. It provides a practical implementation for building real-time web applications that combine HTTP APIs and WebSocket-based communication efficiently.

Key Features
âœ… Koa.js Framework â€“ A lightweight, modern Node.js web framework for building robust HTTP servers.
âœ… Socket.IO Integration â€“ Enables real-time, bidirectional event-based communication between client and server.
âœ… Structured Routing â€“ Organized separation between HTTP routes (REST) and WebSocket events for better maintainability.
âœ… Middleware Support â€“ Leverages Koa middleware for authentication, logging, and error handling in WebSocket connections.
âœ… Modular Architecture â€“ Clean separation of concerns between HTTP controllers and Socket.IO event handlers.

Use Cases
ðŸ”¹ Real-time applications (chat apps, live notifications, collaborative tools)
ðŸ”¹ Hybrid API systems (combining REST endpoints with WebSocket events)
ðŸ”¹ Projects requiring scalable WebSocket routing with authentication and validation

Implementation Highlights
Socket.IO namespaces for grouping related WebSocket events.

Authentication middleware for securing WebSocket connections.

Error handling for both HTTP and real-time connections.

Example routes demonstrating HTTP (GET/POST) and WebSocket (emit/on) interactions.

This repository serves as a reference architecture for developers who want to:
âœ” Use Koa.js for HTTP routing while adding Socket.IO for real-time features.
âœ” Maintain a clean codebase with well-structured API and WebSocket logic.
âœ” Implement scalable WebSocket authentication alongside REST APIs.

Ideal for Node.js developers looking to build modern, real-time applications without sacrificing maintainability.
